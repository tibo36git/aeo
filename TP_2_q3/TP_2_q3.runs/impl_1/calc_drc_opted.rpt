2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BIVB-1#1 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:33
Bank 33 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
seg[3]
Related violations: <none>

BIVB-1#2 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:34
Bank 34 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
an[3:0], led[9], led[10], seg[1], seg[4] and seg[6]
Related violations: <none>

BIVB-1#3 Error
Bank IO standard Support  - IOBank:34
Bank 34 has incompatible IO(s) because: The LVCMOS33 I/O standard is not supported.  Move the following ports or change their properties:  
sw[8] and sw[13]
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-87#1 Error
Clock Placer Checks  
IO/clock placer failed to collectively place all IOs and clock instances. This is likely due to design requirements or user constraints specified in the constraint file such as IO standards, bank/voltage/DCI/VREF specifications, together with the part and package being used for the implementation. Please check the above for any possible conflicts.

Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
22 out of 35 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: led[15], led[14], led[13], led[12], led[11], led[8], led[7], led[6], led[5], led[4], led[3], led[1], seg[5], seg[2], seg[0] (the first 15 of 22 listed).
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PLIO-3#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus led[15:0] are not locked:  led[15] led[14] led[13] led[12] led[11] led[8] led[7] led[6] led[5] led[4] led[3] led[1]
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-3#2 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus seg[6:0] are not locked:  seg[5] seg[2] seg[0]
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-3#3 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus sw[15:0] are not locked:  sw[15] sw[14] sw[12] sw[10] sw[9] sw[7] sw[6] sw[5] sw[4] sw[3] sw[2] sw[1] sw[0]
Related violations: <none>
